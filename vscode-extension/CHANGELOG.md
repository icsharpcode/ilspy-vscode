# Change Log

All notable changes to the "ilspy-vscode" extension will be documented in this file.

## 0.20

- Upgrade to ICSharpCode.Decompiler 9.0 Preview 3 (see release notes for [ILSpy 9.0 Preview 3](https://github.com/icsharpcode/ILSpy/releases/tag/v9.0-preview3))
- Support decompilation to C# 12
- Introduction of "Analyze" feature similar to ILSpy desktop application: You can analyze where a method is called, a type is used or an interface is implemented.

## 0.19

- Add "Search with ILSpy" command in editor's context menu. This allows to search any text or symbol name with ILSpy's symbol search.
- Fix: Reuse previously acquired .NET runtime, if no internet connection is available during VS Code start. Before the fix the extension used to hang during initialization, if no connection to the update server was available.

## 0.18

- Users may choose a C# language version for decompilation
- New "Collapse All" button in tree views
- Internal restructuring of the project on backend side, separating a Language Server layer from basic decompilation, assembly tree handling and search

## 0.17

- Upgrade to ICSharpCode.Decompiler 8.2 (see release notes for [ILSpy 8.2](https://github.com/icsharpcode/ILSpy/releases/tag/v8.2) to get more details)
- Backend process now migrated to .NET 8, so extension locally downloads a .NET 8 runtime on startup
- Search button not shown in "ILSPY: Assemblies" view anymore, when no assemblies were loaded

## 0.16.1

- Fixes for 2 issues with adding assemblies from workspace

## 0.16

- List of decompiled assemblies is now persisted per workspace: Assemblies will appear again as soon as workspace is reloaded. This behavior can be disabled in VS Code settings.
- Decompile any assembly directly from Explorer view
- Small improvements in assembly list (buttons instead of context menus)

## 0.15

- Assembly references are now shown in tree
- Fix for failing unload/reload of assemblies in tree

## 0.14.1

- Fix for missing output language selection

## 0.14

- Introduction of symbol search
- New "Reload assembly" command in "Decompiled Members" tree
- "Decompiled Members" now properly sorted
- Usage of VS Code built-in icons for different symbol types instead of shipping our own icon set
- Extension package (VSIX) now optimized and smaller in size
- Extension is now loaded a bit later to avoid slowing down VS Code startup unnecessarily

## 0.13.1

- Fix zombie backend processes still running after VS Code was closed on Linux and macOS
- Make output language selection less confusing

## 0.13

- Upgrade to .NET 6.0 runtime
- "ILSpy Decompiled Members" view now has a menu to quickly add assemblies without command palette

## 0.12.1

- Fix issue with "Pick assembly from file system" command, where only namespaces were decompiled.

## 0.12

- Only one document is opened now on decompilation (C# or IL). Users can switch the output language in editor toolbar and also preset a default output language in VS Code configuration. Documents are read-only now.
- Previously opened documents with decompiled code are no longer re-opened on restart of VS Code
- Improved decompilation results by resolving dependencies of decompiled assembly (as ILSpy does)

## 0.11.2

- Fixed issues activating the extension on Linux systems, also leading to malfunction of some other extensions

## 0.11

- Re-architecture of internal ILSpy interface (_ILSpy.Backend_) based on .NET 5.0, therefore no Mono dependency on Linux/MacOS any more
