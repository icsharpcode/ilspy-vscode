# ILSpy back end service

## ILSpy.Backend

A backend service providing a [Language Server Procotol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) interface to `ICSharpCode.Decompiler` API.

Apart from general service initialization, following custom LSP messages are supported:

- `ilspy/initWithAssemblies`
- `ilspy/addAssembly`
- `ilspy/removeAssembly`
- `ilspy/decompileNode`
- `ilspy/getNodes`
- `ilspy/search`

The idea of the interface is a dynamic tree of typed _nodes_ representing the list of assemblies and their contents. This is similar to the tree presented in ILSpy desktop application. Clients use `ilspy/getNodes` message to access nodes and their children. To get the code for a specific node (which may be an assembly, a class, a single method etc.), clients use `ilspy/decompileNode` message.

## Develop

To build the solution, use command line:

```
git clone https://github.com/icsharpcode/ilspy-vscode.git
cd ilspy-vscode/backend
dotnet build
```

or open `backend/ILSpy-backend.sln` in Visual Studio 2022 (>= 17.8) or another .NET IDE.
